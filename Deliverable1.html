                <h2>Destiny</h2>
                <p>Destiny, made by the same studio that originated the iconic Halo games, is beautiful, challenging, and fun. The landscapes, both earthly and alien, are at times breathtaking and may cause players to stop fighting simply to appreciate their splendor. But it's the action that will keep players coming back -- especially strike missions, which see teams of three players going up against impossibly powerful bosses and seemingly never-ending waves of lesser enemies. RPG-like leveling and looting let players customize and grow their warriors as they like. An integrated competitive mode called the Crucible lets players engage in traditional multiplayer modes such as deathmatch while evolving their heroes. Add in finely tuned controls and a terrific and seemingly never-ending selection of powerful, upgradeable weapons, and you have the sort of shooter that fans of sci-fi FPS games ought to gobble up.
                And yet, it's not without problems -- chief of which is repetition. The four gorgeously rendered worlds that players get to explore are big enough to fit a few missions without much backtracking, but the game is designed so players continue to visit these locations almost endlessly, eventually making them feel small and over-populated. Plus, players looking for a compelling narrative may come away disappointed, since even the story missions are virtually all action with very little meaningful exposition. The seeds of a fascinating new sci-fi mythology exist, but they never quite sprout. Still, fans of shooters and online games are bound to have a fair bit of fun, even if it doesn't last quite as long as they might have expected, given the immense hype that preceded Destiny's release.</p>

                <h2>Final Fantasy  XV</h2>
                <p>Final Fantasy XV opens, quite fittingly, with a splash screen that reads: “A Final Fantasy for fans and first-timers.” Having played every numbered entry since the first, I can see both reverence for the old and a courtship of the new in this latest chapter. I’d like to say it’s an elegant fusion of the two, but in reality it’s more of a duality - a conflict that reaches into nearly every aspect of Final Fantasy XV. In the end, its beauty, charm, and commitment to the bond between its four protagonists keep it glued together, even when some of its design and story elements threaten to pull it apart.</p>

                <h2>Overwatch</h2>
                <p>Parents need to know that Overwatch is an online multiplayer team-based first-person shooter. Two teams of six players fight against each other in a number of game types; while kids can play with people they know, it's also possible for them to play with strangers -- that, plus the unmoderated chat (which means all bets are off in terms of what kids can hear), is the main reason for our 13+ age rating. Characters fight with a variety of weapons, ranging from more realistic handguns and melee weapons to over-the-top futuristic weapons. Although the violence is a big part of the relatively nonstop action, there's very little in the way of blood. The basics are easy to learn, though the game's large roster of unique characters and abilities adds an extra layer of complexity to the experience. While there's no profanity in the actual game, the online matches could expose players to offensive language from other players. Finally, with Overwatch launching as a brand-new franchise from Blizzard, there's no shortage of tie-in merchandise available, including toys, clothes, books, and more. Some female characters wear revealing outfits, while one character is regularly shown smoking a cigar. </p>
